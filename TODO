identify features I want and implement them independently

  [ ] Error handling, for when a result is not possible
  [ ] Warning and Note handling, for when a result is possible
  [ ] Result handler (in IO), the output can be flagged as TEMP, INTER, or FINAL
    - if TEMP, the value is not saved, only a summary of it
    - if INTER, the value is saved as a file in the temp directory
    - if FINAL, the value is saved as a file in the FINAL directory
  [ ] A caching monad (in IO)
  [ ] A summarization monad

then merge them all into one
